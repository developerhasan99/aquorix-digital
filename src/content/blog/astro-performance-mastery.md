## Speed is a Feature

Astro has revolutionized the way we build websites by delivering zero-gravity ship-to-site performance. With the latest updates in version 5.0, the framework has become even more powerful and efficient.

### Why Performance Matters

- **SEO**: Search engines prioritize fast-loading sites.
- **Conversion**: A 1-second delay can significantly drop conversion rates.
- **User Experience**: Fast sites feel premium and reliable.

By leveraging Astro's partial hydration, we can build rich, interactive experiences without sacrificing speed.
