## Beyond the Logo

A brand is more than just a logo. It's the sum of every interaction a user has with your business. At Aquorix, we take a holistic approach to branding, ensuring that every touchpoint reflects the core values of the company.

### Our Process

1. **Discovery**: Understanding the 'Why' behind the brand.
2. **Strategy**: Defining the visual and verbal tone.
3. **Design**: Creating a scalable identity system.

In a crowded market, an iconic identity is your greatest asset.
